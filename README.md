# Emoji-Detector
Emoji Detector using OpenCV and used Mediapipe to detect hand landmarks.
For the time being the model only recognizes the emojies which are present in the Emoji Pics directory.
This project is still under development and I am trying to learn and add more emoji for the model to recognise.
